# -Data-Visualization-Bar-Chart-or-Histogram

This project demonstrates how to visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using Python libraries **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**
1. **Bar Chart** - Visualizes the distribution of gender (a categorical variable).
2. **Histogram** - Visualizes the distribution of age (a continuous variable).

The project includes two parts:
1. Gender Distribution (Bar Chart)
   - Counts the number of occurrences for each gender category (Male, Female, Other).
   - Displays the result in a bar chart.

2.  Age Distribution (Histogram):
    - Plots a histogram to show the frequency of different age ranges in the dataset.
